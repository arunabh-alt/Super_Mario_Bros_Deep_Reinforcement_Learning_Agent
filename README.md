# Super_Mario_Bros_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning_Agent

This source code folder contains code for training and testing reinforcement learning agents within the Super Mario Bros 2 environment(SuperMarioBros2-v1) . It leverages the Stable Baselines3 library, utilizing specifically the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, alongside other reinforcement learning algorithms such as A2C and DQN. Users can interact with the code via command-line arguments to determine whether to train or test the agent, select the learning algorithm (PPO, A2C, or DQN), and optionally specify a seed number for reproducibility. Furthermore, the codes allows for the customization of hyperparameters such as the environment ID, number of training steps, learning rate, and gamma, providing flexibility for experimentation. The environment is created using specific wrappers for preprocessing, ensuring optimal input for the agents. During training, the agents learn within the specified environment, with the option to save and load pre-trained policies for further evaluation. The effectiveness of the learned policies is assessed using the evaluate_policy function, providing insights into the agent's performance. Additionally, the code includes functionality to visualize the agent's learned behavior by rendering the environment and displaying episode statistics such as steps per episode, reward per episode, and total game score. This comprehensive approach enables users to experiment with various reinforcement learning algorithms and fine-tune parameters to achieve optimal performance in the Super Mario Bros 2 environment.
